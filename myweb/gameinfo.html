        <h1>Game Info!</h1>
        <h2>What is (game name here)?</h2>
        <p>(game name here) is a 2D platformer RPG, that is 
            currently under development, but the end goal is to
            create a memorable and fun game with a bit older take
            on the game style. the first release will (hopefully)
            have a tutorial stage where you can learn the basics,
            a town where you can buy gear, get quests, and other fun stuff,
            and a combat stage where you can fight things, probably just snails.
