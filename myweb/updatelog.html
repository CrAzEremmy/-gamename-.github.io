            <h2>First Update! (not playable yet)</h2>
        <p> What I have done so far is ive just gotten the basic platformer 
            things done. this includes very basic collsion detection,
            movement for the player, AI patrol (which currently cannot 
            detect a wall infront of it, just if the space below is a 
            platform or not), a placeholder for skill shooting 
            (for now the player just shoots a projectile when you click.)
            and instantaneous death when you touch the snail mob, and
            instant respawn afterwards. what i hope to get done this week
            is HP and attacks, possibily inventory too.
        </p>
