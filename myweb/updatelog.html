            <h1>Update Log</h1>
            <h2>First Update! (not playable yet)</h2>
        <p> What I have done so far is ive just gotten the basic platformer 
            things done. this includes very basic collsion detection,
            movement for the player, AI patrol (which currently cannot 
            detect a wall infront of it, just if the space below is a 
            platform or not), a placeholder for skill shooting 
            (for now the player just shoots a projectile when you click.)
            and instantaneous death when you touch the snail mob, and
            instant respawn afterwards. what i hope to get done this week
            is HP and attacks, possibily inventory too.</p>

            <p>Had to completely redo the healthbar system because new unity 
            version doesn't work very well with old code and i spent 4 hours
            trying to get it to work. hope it works this time!
