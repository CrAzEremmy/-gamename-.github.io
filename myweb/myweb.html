    <p>hi, this is my game website that I use to comunicate the progress of
        my game, updates, and the overall state of the game. please go
        to the other pages to find out more about my game! or of your wondering
        whats going on with me, look below (as of 10/21/2020 there is nothing
        going on currently) as I will post personal updates when I can!
        (yes i know this doesnt look very good but I made this all
         myself through VSC, so give it some time  and it'll look better
         ... eventually)
    </p>
